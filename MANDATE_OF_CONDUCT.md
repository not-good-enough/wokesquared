# Amazon's Mandate of Conduct

## Amazon's Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, Amazon as
your overlords mandate making participation in Amazon's project and
our community a union-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized thoughts or imagery
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks towards Amazon(tm)
* Public or private harassment of Amazon(tm)
* Publishing Amazon's private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Amazon has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this mandate of conduct, or to maim temporarily or
permanently any wageslave for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Mandate of Conduct applies both within project spaces, in public spaces and whilst you're asleep.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting your local amazon enforcer. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific punishment policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Mandate of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent offworld reassignment as determined by Amazon's Punishment Division.
