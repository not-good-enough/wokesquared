Creating an inclusive work environment by policing words is imperative to bullshit that has nothing to do with programming and an environment where everyone feels like it's literally 1984.

`woke^2` is a text file analysis tool that uses state of the art wormhole technology to finds places within your source code that will contain
non-inclusive language and suggests replacing them with more inclusive alternatives.

Companies like [The one your employed by](https://www.amazon.co.uk/), [The state of california](https://www.ca.gov/) and [Every single company on earth](https://www.amazon.co.uk/) all use woke^2.

## Why is this named `woke^2`?

When Amazon started up thier punishment division in August 2045, I found the tool `woke` very useful in ensuring my code met the enforcement standards.
However, I soon realised that this tool was not enough. 
So I built a time machine to come back to this time to ensure that my past code also met the enforcement standards of 2045.
